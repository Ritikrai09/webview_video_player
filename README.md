# Play YouTube videos on mobile devices with WebView

Use [IFrame Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference) and WebView to play YouTube videos on mobile devices.

This package leverages [webview_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter) to embed a YouTube video player through the [IFrame Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference). For state management, it utilizes the [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) package.

## Demo

### IFrame player

### Decorated player

## Features

- Customizable player
  - `WebviewtubePlayer` provides a WebView that integrates with the YouTube IFrame Player API, allowing for extensive customization without additional widgets.
- Decorated player with basic controls.
  - `WebviewtubeVideoPlayer` combines the default player with custom widgets, offering a more integrated player with basic controls.

## Supported Platforms

The same as [webview_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter). On Android, hybrid composition mode is used.

- Android: SDK 19+
- iOS: 12.0+

## Setup

### Android

Set the correct `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle`

```groovy
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 19
    }
}
```

### iOS

No configuration needed.

## Usage

Check out `example/lib/` for more details.

### Default IFrame player

```dart
WebviewtubePlayer(videoId: '4AoFA19gbLo')
```

### Widgets decorated player

```dart
WebviewtubeVideoPlayer(videoId: '4AoFA19gbLo')
```

### Configure the player

To customize or interact with the player, you can use a `WebviewtubeController` along with `WebviewtubeOptions`. The controller allows you to configure player options and interact with the player. Follow these steps to set up and use the controller:

1. **Initialize the Controller**: Create an instance of `WebviewtubeController` and pass the desired options using `WebviewtubeOptions`.

2. **Pass the Controller to the Player**: Provide the controller to the player widget.

3. **Dispose of the Controller**: To avoid memory leaks, always dispose of the controller when it's no longer needed to free up resources.

```dart
// ...
// inside a state of a stateful widget
late final WebviewtubeController controller;

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  controller = WebviewtubeController(
    options: const WebviewtubeOptions(
      enableCaption: false,
    ),
  );
}

@override
void dispose() {
  controller.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return WebviewtubePlayer(
      videoId: '4AoFA19gbLo',
      controller: controller,
    );
}
```

## Customize the player

This package uses [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) for state management, but you're free to fork and use your preferred tools. To create a customized player, explore the source code of `WebviewtubeVideoPlayer` and modify it according to your needs.

### Using `StatefulWidget` and `setState`

For an example of integrating the player with a `StatefulWidget`, refer to `example/lib/customized_player.dart`. This example demonstrates how to control the player and update the UI based on player events and state changes.
